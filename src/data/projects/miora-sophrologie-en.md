## The client

Miora is a french sophrologist who needed a website to showcase her activity and get more clients. She also needed a website tailored to her personality. This way, end-users kinda know her before taking booking a consultation. 

## The process

We used an iterative process with a constant feedback to make sure we are always on the same page. We followed those steps :

- Draft : meetings and drawings with plain old paper an pencil
- Mock up using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- Development
- Delivery

> For both the mock-up and the development processes, a link is made available to see real time progression
