            If you're already using a client component and still encounter the "useRouter was not mounted" error, it's possible that the component is being rendered on the server-side during the initial load or during server-side rendering (SSR). In this case, you can use the useEffect hook to ensure that the router object is only accessed after the component has been mounted on the client-side.

Here's an example of how to use the useEffect hook to safely access the router object in a client component:



export default RouteTracker;

In this example, the useEffect hook is used to log the current path to the console whenever the router object is ready and the pathname changes. The router.isReady property is used to ensure that the router object has been initialized on the client-side.

Similarly, the component returns the current path only when the router.isReady property is true. If the router object is not ready, the component returns null to avoid rendering any content.

By using the useEffect hook and the router.isReady property, you can safely access the router object and print the current routing path in a client component without encountering the "useRouter was not mounted" error.
